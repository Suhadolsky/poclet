The **Retroid Pocket 4 Pro** is the current king of the "mid-range" handheld market. For under $200, it offers performance that rivals devices twice its price.

## Overview

Retroid finally nailed it. The Dimensity 1100 chipset is a beast for emulation. Unlike previous generations, this handheld doesn't struggle with PS2 or GameCube. It just plays them.

### What Can It Emulate? 🎮

*   **PS2:** 100% full speed (mostly 2x-3x resolution).
*   **GameCube:** 100% full speed.
*   **Wii:** Playable (some motion control issues).
*   **3DS:** Solid (Citra runs well).
*   **Switch:** Some lighter 2D games run okay (Yuzu/Skyline), but don't expect *Zelda: TOTK*.

### Android 13 📱

Since it runs Android, you get access to:
*   **Daijishō frontend:** Beautiful game library.
*   **Cloud Gaming:** Xbox Game Pass, GeForce Now.
*   **Native Android Games:** Genshin Impact (runs well on Medium/High).

## Verdict

If you want to play PS2/GC on the go and don't want a bulky Steam Deck, buy the **Retroid Pocket 4 Pro**.
