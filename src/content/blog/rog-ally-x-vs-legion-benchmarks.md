**By PocketCore Labs | Performance Analysis**

With the release of the "Xbox Edition" updates for the ROG Ally X, performance has stabilized. But how does it compare to the massive screen of the Legion Go? We ran the numbers.

## The Test Bench 🖥️

*   **Game:** Cyberpunk 2077 (v2.1)
*   **Settings:** 1080p / Low / FSR Balanced
*   **TDP:** 25W (Turbo Mode)

### Results (Avg FPS)

| Device | FPS | 1% Lows |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROG Ally X** | **48 FPS** | 35 FPS |
| **Legion Go** | 45 FPS | 30 FPS |
| **Steam Deck OLED** | 32 FPS | 24 FPS |

**Analysis:** The faster 7500MHz RAM in the Ally X gives it a clear edge in 1% lows (stuttering). It feels smoother, even if the average FPS is close.

## Battery Drain Test ⚡

We looped *Red Dead Redemption 2* at 15W TDP until death.

*   **ROG Ally X (80Wh):** 3 hours 42 minutes.
*   **Legion Go (49Wh):** 1 hour 55 minutes.
*   **Winner:** ROG Ally X by a landslide.

## Memory Cooling ❄️

Lenovo's thermal solution is quieter, but ASUS cools the SD card slot better. In our thermal camera test, the Ally X's screen reached 38°C, while the Legion Go stayed cool at 32°C thanks to its size.

## Recommendation

If you prioritize **battery life and VRR**, get the **ROG Ally X**.
If you need the **biggest screen possible** for strategy games, get the **Legion Go**.
