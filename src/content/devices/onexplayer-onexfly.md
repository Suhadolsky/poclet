The enthusiast's choice. OneXPlayer devices are for those who want to stand out from the Deck/Ally crowd and don't mind paying for specialized hardware.

**Community Interest:** High-end specs, boutique designs, specialized features like OC buttons.

**John's Wiki Note:** 💎 *Boutique power. Beautiful devices, but you're often your own tech support.*
