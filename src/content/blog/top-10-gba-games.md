The **Miyoo Mini Plus** and **RG35XX** were born to play Game Boy Advance. The aspect ratio is close enough, and the pixel density makes pixel art look crisp.
Here is your starter pack.

## 1. Metroid Fusion 👽
Ideally played in the dark. The atmosphere, the sound design, and the tight controls make it the best handheld Metroid.
*   **Why on Miyoo:** The vibrant colors pop on modern IPS screens.

## 2. Golden Sun ☀️
The RPG that pushed the GBA to its limits. The summons still look impressive today.
*   **Why on Miyoo:** Turn-based gameplay is perfect for one-handed play while commuting.

## 3. Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising 🎖️
Chess with tanks. The ultimate "just one more turn" game.
*   **Why on Miyoo:** Quick save/load states (OnionOS) let you cheat the RNG. We won't judge.

## 4. The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap 🟢
The most underrated 2D Zelda. Capcom developed it, and the sprite work is arguably better than *A Link to the Past*.

## 5. WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames! 🤪
Pure chaos. 5-second minigames.
*   **Why on Miyoo:** Perfect for 2-minute bus waits.

## 6. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow 🏰
Soma Cruz collects souls. It's "Pokemon meets Castlevania". The best "Metroidvania" on the system.

## 7. Pokémon Unbound (Rom Hack) 💎
Okay, this isn't an official game. But it's better. It features Gen 8 mechanics, mega evolutions, and a new story.
*   **Pro Tip:** Miyoo handles Rom Hacks perfectly.

## 8. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 🗡️
Hundreds of hours of content. Build your clan, learn the laws, break the laws.

## 9. Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga 🍄
An RPG where you have to dodge attacks manually. Funny writing and great mechanics.

## 10. Drill Dozer 🔩
Made by Game Freak (Pokemon devs). You drive a mech with a drill. It originally had a rumble pak in the cartridge.
*   **Miyoo Tip:** Turn on vibration in RetroArch to simulate the rumble!
