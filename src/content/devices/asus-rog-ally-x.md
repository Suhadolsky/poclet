The **ROG Ally X** is not just a refresh; it's what the original Ally should have been. It fixes the battery life and SD card issues.

## 💿 Software Guide

| App | Type | Why use it? | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bazzite** | OS | Turns Ally X into a Steam Deck (SteamOS Clone). | [Bazzite.gg](https://bazzite.gg/) |
| **Playnite** | Frontend | Best launcher for Windows. Hides the desktop. | [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) |
| **G-Helper** | Utility | Lightweight replacement for Armoury Crate (saves battery). | [GitHub](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper) |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting (Fixes)

### 1. SD Card Reader Fried?
*   **Status:** The *original* Ally fried SD cards due to heat.
*   **Ally X Fix:** ASUS moved the SD slot away from the vent. It is **SAFE** on the Ally X.

### 2. Sticks Feel Loose
*   **Fix:** The Ally X uses new stick modules (tighter than original). If they feel loose, you can tighten the tension springs inside (requires opening) or increase deadzone in Armoury Crate.

### 3. Windows Updates Broke Something
*   **Fix:** Always update **MyASUS** and **Armoury Crate** first. Windows Update sometimes installs generic drivers that break special keys.
