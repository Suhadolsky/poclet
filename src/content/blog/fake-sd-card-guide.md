We see it every day on Reddit. *"My Miyoo Mini won't turn on!"* or *"My Pokemon save is gone!"*.
99% of the time, the culprit is the **Generic No-Name SD Card** that came with the device.

## The "Stock Card" Rule 🚫

If your console came with a card that says "64GB" but has no brand name (or just says "High Speed"), **THROW IT AWAY**.
Seriously. Snap it in half.
These cards are low quality and prone to corruption within weeks.

## Recommended Brands ✅

Stick to the big players. They are cheap now (a 128GB card is ~$15).
*   **Samsung:** Evo Select / Evo Plus (White/Blue). Reliable and fast.
*   **SanDisk:** Ultra (Grey/Red) or Extreme (Gold).
*   **Silicon Power:** Good budget option.

## How to Spot a Fake (The "H2testw" Method) 🕵️

Sometimes even branded cards are fake (if you bought from a shady seller).
The fake cards hack the controller to report "1TB" to your PC, but really only have 8GB of flash storage. When you copy more than 8GB, it overwrites the beginning, destroying your data.

**The Test:**
1.  Download **h2testw** (Windows) or **F3** (Mac/Linux).
2.  Plug the card into your PC.
3.  Run the test. It will write data to fill the ENTIRE card, then read it back.
4.  **Result:** If it says "Data Lost" or "Corrupted", the card is fake. Return it immediately.

## Backup Your BIOS 🧬

Before you throw away the stock card, **copy the BIOS folder** to your PC. Finding BIOS files online can be annoying legally. The rest (Roms) is better to download fresh ("Tiny Best Set Go" is your friend).
