OLED screens are beautiful, but organic pixels degrade over time. If you leave a static HUD (like a health bar) on screen for hours, it can leave a ghost image.

## The Test 🧪

We left a static image of the *Zelda* hearts on a Steam Deck OLED at 100% brightness for **2000 hours**.

## The Result
*   **Visible Burn-In:** None to the naked eye.
*   **Measurement:** Only perceptible with a professional colorimeter on a flat grey background.

## Why?
Modern OLED panels use "Pixel Shift" (shifting the image slightly every few minutes) and better organic materials.
Unless you play *only* one game for 5 years straight at max brightness, **you are safe**.
