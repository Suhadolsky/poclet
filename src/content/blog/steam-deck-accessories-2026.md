The Steam Deck OLED is amazing, but it's naked without accessories.
Here is the loadout we use at PocketCore daily.

## 1. The Dock: JSAUX 6-in-1 (HB0603) ⚓
Valve's official dock is great but expensive ($80).
The **JSAUX** dock ($30) does the exact same thing. HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), Ethernet, and 3 USB ports. It fits perfectly even with a case on.

## 2. The Case: Dbrand Killswitch 🛡️
It's pricey ($60), but it's a tank. The textured grip feels incredible, and the kickstand is rock solid. Plus, the "Travel Cover" protects the screen in your bag, so you don't need a bulky zipper case.

## 3. The Power Bank: Anker 737 (PowerCore 24K) 🔋
This brick outputs 140W. It can charge your Steam Deck at full speed (45W) while also charging your phone and your laptop.
*   **Capacity:** Charges the Deck ~1.5 times.
*   **Display:** Shows exactly how many watts are going in/out.

## 4. Screen Protector: JSaux Anti-Glare ☀️
If you bought the 512GB model (glossy screen), this is a must. It cuts reflections significantly without making the image look grainy.

## 5. MicroSD: Samsung Pro Plus 512GB 💾
Don't overpay for "Extreme Pro". The Steam Deck's slot is limited to UHS-I speeds. The Samsung Pro Plus is the fastest card that maxes out the Deck's slot, and it's often on sale.
