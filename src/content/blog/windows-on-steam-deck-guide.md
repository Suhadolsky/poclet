Valve officially supports SteamOS. Windows support is... an afterthought.
But if you want to play *Destiny 2*, *Fortnite*, or *Game Pass* natively, you need Windows.

## The OLED Driver Situation ⚠️

For a long time, the OLED model lacked Wi-Fi and Audio drivers for Windows.
**Good news:** Valve released them late last year.
**Bad news:** They are still buggy. Bluetooth headphones sometimes disconnect, and the speakers sound tinny compared to SteamOS.

## Is it worth it?
*   **Yes:** Only for Anti-Cheat games (CoD, Fortnite).
*   **No:** For everything else. You lose the quick resume, the fan control, and the seamless UI.

**Our Advice:** Keep SteamOS. Stream Game Pass via Cloud.
