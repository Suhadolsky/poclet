## 💿 Firmware Guide

| OS Name | Status | Why use it? | Link |

> **Pro Tip:** Do not use the SD card included in the box. Buy a Samsung Evo or SanDisk Ultra immediately.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting (Fixes)

### 1. Black Screen / Won't Turn On
*   **Cause:** Usually a bad SD card or loose ribbon cable.
*   **Fix:**
    1. Try a different SD card with fresh OnionOS.
    2. Open the back (4 screws), unplug battery, carefully reseat the wide orange screen ribbon cable.

### 2. Screen Falling Out
*   **Cause:** Weak adhesive in early batches.
*   **Fix:** Use a tiny amount of B-7000 glue or thin double-sided phone repair tape around the bezel.

### 3. Wi-Fi Not Connecting
*   **Cause:** 5GHz networks are not supported.
*   **Fix:** Connect only to **2.4GHz** Wi-Fi networks.
