The **Powkiddy RGB30** is a weird device. Who makes a square screen in 2026? But once you load up a Game Boy game, you understand.

## Why the Square Screen? 🟩

Most retro systems (SNES, NES, GB) are 8:7 or near-square. On a normal 16:9 screen, you get huge black bars. On the RGB30, **Game Boy Color fills the entire screen**. It's glorious.
Also, if you play **Pico-8** (the fantasy console), this is the only way to play. It fits pixel-perfectly.

## The "Charging Issue" (Read This!) 🔋

I almost returned mine because I thought it was broken. It wasn't. It's just picky.
*   **The Problem:** The battery percentage lies. It says 0% when it's 100%, or gets stuck.
*   **The Fix:** You MUST open the back and disconnect/reconnect the battery once to calibrate it. Also, use a USB-A to USB-C cable. C-to-C chargers will not work.

## Software: Rocknix vs ArkOS

I switched to **ArkOS**. It feels snappier and handles the weird resolution better. Rocknix (formerly JELOS) is fine, but updates have slowed down.

## Verdict

It's a niche device. But if you love Game Boy, Neo Geo Pocket, or Pico-8, there is literally nothing better on the market.
