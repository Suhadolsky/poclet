## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 1. Hinge Crack
*   **Issue:** Hairline cracks appearing near the hinge after a month.
*   **Fix:** Loosen the two screws near the hinge by 1/4 turn. They are overtightened from the factory.

### 2. Analog Drift
*   **Issue:** The sticks drift out of the box.
*   **Fix:** Go to Settings -> Input -> Calibrate Joysticks. It's a software calibration issue, not hardware.
