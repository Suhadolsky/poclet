The **ROG Ally X** is a beast hardware-wise, but Windows 11 holds it back. Let's fix that.
This guide will help you squeeze every drop of performance out of the Z1 Extreme chip.

## Step 1: Nuke Armoury Crate 🗑️

ASUS's software is heavy.
1.  Uninstall **Armoury Crate SE**.
2.  Install **G-Helper**. It's a lightweight, open-source tool that controls TDP, Fan Curves, and RGB. It uses 0% CPU in the background.

## Step 2: Install Playnite (The "Xbox" Interface) 🎮

Windows Desktop is terrible on a 7-inch screen.
1.  Download **Playnite**.
2.  Install the "XBOX Series" theme.
3.  Set Playnite to launch on startup in "Fullscreen Mode".

Now, when you turn on your Ally, it looks exactly like an Xbox Series X. No mouse required.

## Step 3: Disable "Core Isolation" 🛡️

For some reason, Windows security features eat up 5-10% of gaming performance on the Z1 chip.
*   Go to **Windows Security** -> **Device Security** -> **Core Isolation**.
*   Turn **OFF** Memory Integrity.
*   **Result:** +5 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077.

## Step 4: The 900p Sweet Spot 🍬

Don't play at 1080p. It kills battery.
Don't play at 720p. It looks blurry.
Set your resolution to **900p** (1600x900). With RSR (Radeon Super Resolution) enabled, it looks almost native but saves 20% GPU power.

## Conclusion

With these tweaks, the Ally X lasts **4.5 hours** in indie games and feels like a true console.
