There is a specific sound. *Snap.*
It's the sound of closing a Game Boy Advance SP in 2003. It's the sound of "Game Over".
And now, in 2026, the **Miyoo Flip** has brought that sound back.

## The Design: Pure Retro Chic ✨

I'll be honest: I bought this for the vibes.
Unlike the Anbernic RG35XX SP, which feels a bit brutalist and thick, the Miyoo Flip is sleek. The plastics feel softer, more like an original Nintendo product.
And yes, the hinge snaps perfectly.

## The Sticks: A Game Changer 🕹️

The biggest flaw of the Anbernic SP was the lack of analog sticks.
Miyoo added **two** flat sliders (similar to the 3DS).
*   **Do they work?** Yes.
*   **Are they amazing?** No. They are a bit shallow.
*   **Do they let you play N64?** Absolutely. *Super Mario 64* controls perfectly.

## Software: OnionOS is Life 🧅

The stock OS is trash. Don't even look at it.
I flashed the beta version of **OnionOS Flip** immediately.
Closing the lid puts the device into deep sleep. Opening it wakes it up instantly. This "pickup and play" ability is what makes the Flip superior to everything else.

## Verdict: 8.5/10

It's not the most powerful device (it's just an RK3566). But it's the one I actually carry in my pocket.
If you miss the SP era, buy this.
