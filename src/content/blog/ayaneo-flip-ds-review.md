**By PocketCore | Hardware Review**

The **Ayaneo Flip DS** is the weirdest device of 2025. It's a clamshell Windows PC with a second, smaller screen where the keyboard should be.
Is it practical? No.
Is it the ultimate emulation machine? Yes.

## The Dual Screen Magic ✨

We loaded up *Citra* (3DS Emulator).
Usually, on a Steam Deck, you have to compromise: side-by-side screens (too small) or switching screens (annoying).
On the Flip DS, you drag the bottom screen to the... bottom screen.
*   **Result:** It looks exactly like a real 3DS, but upscaled to 1080p. Playing *Ocarina of Time 3D* this way feels illegal. It's that good.

## The Specs ⚙️

*   **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 8840U.
*   **Main Screen:** 7" 120Hz IPS.
*   **Second Screen:** 3.5" Touch.

## Verdict

If you are obsessed with DS/3DS/Wii U emulation, this is your holy grail. For everyone else, the Steam Deck is cheaper.
