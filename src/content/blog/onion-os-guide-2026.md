If you just bought a **Miyoo Mini** or **Miyoo Mini Plus**, the first thing you must do is **throw away the stock SD card**. Seriously, throw it away. It's garbage and will corrupt your saves.

The second thing? **Install OnionOS**.

## Why OnionOS? 🧅

The stock firmware is okay, but OnionOS transforms this device.
*   **Game Switcher:** Instant save states when you quit a game. Jump back in exactly where you left off.
*   **Themes:** Hundreds of ways to customize your menu.
*   **Performance:** Better emulation for PS1 and GBA.
*   **Box Art:** Scrape your games automatically.

## What You Need 🛠️

1.  **Miyoo Mini / Plus** (obviously).
2.  **Brand Name SD Card** (Samsung Evo Select or SanDisk Ultra, 64GB-128GB recommended).
3.  **USB SD Card Reader**.
4.  **PC / Mac**.

## Step 1: Format the SD Card 💾

Format your new SD card to **FAT32**.
*   **Windows:** Use *GUIFormat*.
*   **Mac:** Disk Utility (MS-DOS FAT).

## Step 2: Download OnionOS ⬇️

Go to the [official OnionOS GitHub releases page](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/releases) and download the latest stable zip file (v4.3 or newer).

## Step 3: Install & Copy 📂

1.  Extract the zip file contents to the **root** of your empty SD card.
2.  Insert the SD card into your Miyoo Mini.
3.  Turn it on. The installer will launch automatically.
4.  Select your device model.
5.  Wait for it to finish.

## Step 4: Add BIOS & ROMs 🎮

Now put the SD card back into your PC. You will see new folders:
*   `BIOS/` -> Place your BIOS files here (PS1 requires `scph1001.bin`).
*   `Roms/` -> Place your game files here (GBA in `GBA`, PS1 in `PS`, etc).

> **Pro Tip:** Google "Tiny Best Set Go" for a curated collection of ROMs and BIOS files ready for Miyoo Mini.

## Troubleshooting ⚠️

*   **Stuck on logo?** Try re-formatting the card.
*   **Missing games?** Refresh your rom list by pressing `Select` on the main menu.

Enjoy your ultimate retro machine!
