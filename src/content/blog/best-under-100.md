Gaming on a budget? You are in luck. In 2026, the sub-$100 market is fiercely competitive.
You can get a device with a stunning screen and perfect PS1 emulation for the price of a new PS5 game.

Here are our top picks.

## 1. Miyoo Mini Plus ($60) 👑
**The King.** It's small, it runs OnionOS (the best software ever made), and it has Wi-Fi for RetroAchievements.
*   **Best for:** Game Boy, SNES, PS1.
*   **Vibe:** Classic Game Boy nostalgia.

## 2. Anbernic RG35XX SP ($70) 📁
**The Clamshell.** It folds in half like the GBA SP. The clicky buttons are satisfying, and it's tough enough to survive a backpack without a case.
*   **Best for:** Commuting (Pocketability).

## 3. TrimUI Smart Pro ($55) 📺
**The Vita Clone.** It has a wide 5-inch screen, making it perfect for GBA (widescreen patch) and PSP.
*   **Best for:** PSP, PortMaster games.

## 4. Retroid Pocket 2S ($99) 🕹️
**The Powerhouse.** It sits right at the $99 limit, but you get Android and Hall Effect sticks. It can even handle some N64 and Dreamcast flawlessly.
*   **Best for:** N64, Dreamcast.

## 5. DataFrog R36S ($35) 🐸
**The Dirt Cheap Option.** The build quality is cheap, the buttons rattle, but it plays the same games as the $80 devices.
*   **Best for:** Kids, or as a backup device.

### Verdict
If you want the best experience, get the **Miyoo Mini Plus**.
If you want to play N64, spend the extra cash for the **Retroid Pocket 2S**.
