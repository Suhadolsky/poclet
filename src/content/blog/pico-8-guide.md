**Pico-8** is a "fantasy console" that never existed. It has strict limits (128x128 resolution, 16 colors), which breeds incredible creativity.
The **Miyoo Mini** is the perfect home for it.

## How to Set It Up 🛠️

1.  **Buy Pico-8:** Go to the Lexaloffle website ($15). You need the `pico8_dyn` (Raspberry Pi) files.
2.  **Copy to Miyoo:** Place the files in `App/Pico-8` on your SD card.
3.  **OnionOS Magic:** OnionOS will detect it.

## The Killer Feature: Splore 📡

If you have a Miyoo Mini Plus (with Wi-Fi), you can use **Splore**.
It connects to the BBS (Bulletin Board System) and lets you browse, download, and play new games *instantly* from the device.
It's like Game Pass for indie pixel art games.

## Games to Try
*   *Celeste Classic* (The original).
*   *Beckon the Hellspawn* (Doom-like).
*   *High Stakes* (Vampire card game).
