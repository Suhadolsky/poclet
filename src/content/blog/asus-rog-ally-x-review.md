When the first ROG Ally launched, it was a "Steam Deck killer" that couldn't survive more than 60 minutes away from a power outlet. In 2026, looking back at the **ROG Ally X**, it’s clear that ASUS didn't just iterate; they performed a full heart transplant.

If you’re looking for a Windows-based handheld that doesn't compromise, this is it.

## 1. The Heart of the Beast: Ryzen Z2 Extreme ⚡
The Ally X we are testing in 2026 features the **Z2 Extreme** chip. Combined with **24GB of LPDDR5X RAM**, it flies through Windows 11.
*   **Multitasking:** You can actually have Discord, a browser, and a game running without the system choking.
*   **Performance:** In *Cyberpunk 2077*, we’re seeing a stable 50-60 FPS at 1080p (Medium settings with FSR 4.0).

## 2. The 80Wh Battery: Actual Freedom 🔋
This is the headline. ASUS doubled the battery capacity from 40Wh to **80Wh**.
*   **AAA Gaming:** 2.5 - 3 hours (The original did 1 hour).
*   **Indie/Retro:** 9-10 hours.
*   **John’s Take:** 🚀 *I finally stopped carrying my 20,000mAh power bank everywhere. My backpack is 1kg lighter and my soul is 100% happier.*

## 3. Ergonomics and Thermals 🌡️
The "X" model is slightly thicker and heavier, but it feels much better in the hand. The deeper grips and repositioned joysticks make long sessions comfortable.
*   **The SD Card Fix:** The original Ally famously "fried" SD cards. The Ally X moved the slot away from the exhaust vents. In 6 months of testing, we’ve had zero failures.
*   **Silent Mode:** The new fans are significantly quieter. At 15W TDP, you can barely hear them in a quiet room.

## 4. Windows 11 in 2026: Still Windows 🪟
Microsoft finally released the **"Handheld Mode"** for Windows 11 in late 2025. It’s better, but it’s still not SteamOS. You will still occasionally see a weird pop-up or a driver error. If you want a console experience, get a Deck. If you want a PC in your hands, get the Ally X.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
*   **Unrivaled Battery Life** for a Windows device.
*   **VRR Screen** makes gaming smoother than the Steam Deck.
*   **24GB RAM** is a future-proofing masterstroke.

**Cons:**
*   **Heavier** than the original model.
*   **Windows 11** still has its "jank" moments.
*   **Price:** It’s significantly more expensive than the Steam Deck OLED.

## John's Vibe Check 🎮
The **ROG Ally X** is for the person who wants to do everything. Emulation, Game Pass, Epic Games, and maybe even some light work. It is the most complete Windows handheld ever made.
