The **Miyoo Mini Plus** is arguably the best entry-level retro handheld ever made. It fixes the biggest issue of the original Mini (too small for adult hands) while keeping everything that made it great.

## Overview

It's a vertical Game Boy-style handheld designed for 8-bit and 16-bit systems. If your goal is to play **Game Boy Advance, SNES, Genesis, or PS1**, this is the device to get.

### Performance 🎮

Don't expect it to run N64 or PSP. The single-core processor is optimized for 2D gaming. However, for PS1 and below, it runs flawlessly.

### The Secret Weapon: OnionOS 🧅

The stock firmware is usable, but **OnionOS** is mandatory. It adds:
*   **Game Switcher:** Instant save/load.
*   **Themes:** Endless customization.
*   **Scraper:** Auto-download box art.

## Verdict

If you have $60 and love retro games, buy this. It's the perfect travel companion.
