In 2026, you can buy an Anbernic RG556 with an OLED screen for $170. So why are people still buying used **PS Vitas** for $150?

## The "Soul" Factor 👻

The Vita has something Chinese emulators lack: **Build Quality**. The d-pad is legendary. The UI (LiveArea) is unique. It feels like a premium Sony product.

## What Can It Do?
*   **Adrenaline:** Runs the entire PSP library natively (perfect hardware emulation).
*   **Ports:** The community has ported *GTA: San Andreas*, *Max Payne*, and *Bully* to run natively on Vita.
*   **Remote Play:** Still works with PS4 (and PS5 with Chiaki).

## The Verdict
Don't buy it for emulation (Retroid is better).
Buy it for **Vita games** (*Persona 4 Golden*, *Gravity Rush*) and PSP classics. It is a piece of history that still feels futuristic.
