I picked up the **TrimUI Smart Pro** purely because it was on sale for $45, expecting a cheap plastic toy. I was wrong. This thing feels premium.

## My Experience 🎮

First off, the screen. It's a 720p panel that looks suspiciously like the PS Vita's LCD. Colors pop, it gets bright, and PSP games look incredible at 2x resolution.

### The "Must-Have" Mod: CrossMix OS

Out of the box, the software is... okay. But once I installed **CrossMix OS**, it transformed.
*   **Performance:** God of War: Chains of Olympus went from a stuttery mess to a playable 30fps.
*   **UI:** It looks cleaner than devices costing three times as much.

## Real Talk: The Flaws ⚠️

It's not perfect.
1.  **LED Sticks:** The RGB lights under the analog sticks bleed into your eyes at night. I turned them off immediately (Fn + R3).
2.  **Heat:** After 30 minutes of Dreamcast, the back gets toasty. Not "burn your hands" hot, but "hand warmer" hot.

## Verdict

For $50? It's a steal. If you want to play PSP and GBA on a budget, buy this and install CrossMix. Don't think twice.
