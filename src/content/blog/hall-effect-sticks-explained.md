We've all been there. Your character starts walking to the left on their own. **Stick Drift.**
It happens because traditional potentiometers use physical wipers that wear down over time.

## The Magnetic Solution 🧲

**Hall Effect** sensors use magnetic fields to detect position.
There is **no physical contact**. No friction. No wear.
This means:
1.  **Zero Drift:** It will stay accurate for 10+ years.
2.  **Smaller Deadzones:** You can set the deadzone to 0% for instant responsiveness in shooters.

## Which Devices Have Them?
*   Retroid Pocket 4 Pro
*   Anbernic RG556
*   Ayaneo (Most models)
*   **NOT:** Switch Joy-Cons (Stock) or Steam Deck LCD (Stock).

**Verdict:** If you are buying a handheld in 2026, demand Hall Effect sticks.
