February 2026 is shaping up to be a historic month for handheld gaming. From Nintendo's massive Pokemon celebration to the first wave of "Switch 2 Enhanced" patches, there is a lot to cover.

Here is your **PocketCore News Roundup**.

## 1. Pokemon Day 2026: The Big 30th Anniversary 🎂

It's official. The Pokemon Company has announced a **Pokemon Presents** showcase for **February 27th, 2026**.
This isn't just any anniversary—it's the big **30**.

**What to expect:**
*   **Gen 10 Teaser:** Rumors suggest the next mainline game will launch late 2026 on Switch 2.
*   **Classic Drops:** *Pokemon FireRed* and *LeafGreen* have been spotted on the eShop backend. They are expected to drop immediately after the show.
*   **Pokemon TCG Pocket:** A new "Paldean Wonder" expansion is coming next week.

> **Our Take:** If Nintendo doesn't announce a new *Legends* game, we riot.

## 2. Switch 2 Upgrades are Here (And They Are Glorious) 🚀

The **Nintendo Switch 2** (released late 2025) is finally flexing its muscles. Developers are rolling out "Enhanced Edition" patches for older games.

*   **Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition:** The new patch adds a **4K/60fps** mode for docked play and a rock-solid **1080p/60fps** in handheld. The world of Mira has never looked this good.
*   **Skyrim Anniversary Edition (Update 1.2):** Yes, Todd Howard did it again. The new update adds a "60Hz Performance Mode" on Switch 2. Loading times are now instant thanks to the SSD.

## 3. Monster Hunter Wilds on a Handheld? 🦖

Dataminers digging through the latest PC update for *Monster Hunter Wilds* found references to a "NX2" (Nintendo Switch 2) graphics profile.
*   **The Leak:** Code suggests the game will run at dynamic 1080p/30fps on the new handheld.
*   **Why it matters:** This confirms that the Switch 2 can handle current-gen AAA engines like RE Engine without melting.

## 4. Steam Deck 2 Rumors Heat Up 🔥

While Nintendo dominates the headlines, Valve is quiet. Too quiet.
Recent leaks from supply chain analysts in Taiwan suggest that Valve has secured a large order of **OLED panels** for a new device entering mass production in Q3 2026.
Could this be the **Steam Deck 2**? Or just a "Steam Deck Lite"? We'll keep digging.
