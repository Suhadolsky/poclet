The retro gaming market in 2026 isn't just about ROMs and piracy. Many gamers want to own physical media and play on high-quality hardware. This has led to a battle between two very different philosophies: the **Analogue Pocket** and the **Evercade EXP**.

<!-- ADS_PLACEHOLDER -->

## 1. The Core Philosophy 🧠
*   **Analogue Pocket:** Focused on **transistor-level accuracy** via FPGA. It’s for the purist who owns original Game Boy, SNES, and GBA cartridges. It wants to recreate the past perfectly.
*   **Evercade EXP:** Focused on **curated collections**. You buy new cartridges containing 6-10 legally licensed classic games (Atari, Namco, Capcom). It’s for the collector who wants a modern, "packaged" experience.

## 2. Hardware and Screen 📺
*   **Analogue Pocket:** Has a 1600x1440 display (615 ppi). It is arguably the best handheld screen ever made for 2D graphics. 
*   **Evercade EXP:** Has a standard 4.3-inch 480p IPS screen. It looks good, but it’s not in the same league as the Analogue.
*   **Winner:** **Analogue Pocket** by a mile.

## 3. Features: TATE and openFPGA 🕹️
*   **Evercade EXP:** Has a dedicated **"TATE Mode"** button. This allows you to turn the console vertically to play arcade shooters (Shmups) using a secondary set of buttons. It’s brilliant.
*   **Analogue Pocket:** Supports **openFPGA**, allowing you to play almost any system up to the mid-90s with 100% accuracy. It is a "one console to rule them all" machine.
*   **Winner:** **Tie.** TATE mode is a dream for arcade fans; openFPGA is a dream for everyone else.

## 4. Availability and Price 💸
*   **Analogue Pocket:** Hard to find, often scalped, and costs $249+ (for plastic) or $499 (for aluminum).
*   **Evercade EXP:** Readily available at major retailers for around $149. Cartridges are affordable (~$20).
*   **Winner:** **Evercade** for accessibility.

## Comparison Summary

| Feature | Analogue Pocket | Evercade EXP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Media Type** | Original Carts / ROMs | New Evercade Carts |
| **Technology** | FPGA (Accurate) | Emulation |
| **Price** | $250 - $500 | ~$149 |
| **Best For** | Purists / Techies | Collectors / Casuals |

## John's Vibe Check 💎
The **Analogue Pocket** is a luxury item. It’s the "Rolex" of handhelds. The **Evercade EXP** is more like a high-end toy—it’s fun, it’s legal, and it’s nostalgic without the stress of finding 30-year-old cartridges. 

**My advice:** If you have a box of old games in the attic, get the Pocket. If you just want to buy a cool box at the store and start playing, get the Evercade.
