Android is great, but navigating touch menus with a controller sucks. You need a **Frontend**.

## 1. Daijishō (Free) 🦊
The fan favorite. It scrapes box art automatically, supports RetroAchievements, and looks stunning.
*   **Pros:** Free, lightweight, "Widgets" support.
*   **Cons:** Updating scraper sources can be tricky.

## 2. ES-DE (EmulationStation) 💰
The classic interface from Linux, now on Android.
*   **Pros:** Supports themes (hundreds of them). Extremely customizable.
*   **Cons:** Paid (on Patreon/Amazon Appstore). No Play Store version.

## 3. Beacon 🔦
The minimalist choice. Clean, fast, no clutter.
*   **Pros:** Easiest setup.
*   **Cons:** Fewer themes than ES-DE.

**Recommendation:** Start with **Daijishō**. It’s free and fantastic.
