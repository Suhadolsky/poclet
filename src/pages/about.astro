	<p>
		Welcome to <strong>PocketCore</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		We live in the golden age of portable gaming. From the high-end power of the Steam Deck and ROG Ally to the nostalgic charm of Miyoo Mini and Anbernic devices, there has never been a better time to play on the go.
	</p>

	<p>
		But the information is scattered. Reddit threads, Discord servers, YouTube comments... finding the right firmware or the best settings can be a nightmare.
	</p>

	<h3>Our Mission 🚀</h3>
	<p>
		PocketCore is built to be the <strong>single source of truth</strong> for handheld enthusiasts.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>No fluff:</strong> We get straight to the point.</li>
		<li><strong>Tested guides:</strong> If we write about it, we've tested it.</li>
		<li><strong>Community first:</strong> We focus on what players actually need, not just what's hyped.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The Team 👨‍💻</h3>
	<p>
		PocketCore was founded by <strong>Suhadolsky</strong>, a handheld gaming enthusiast who spent way too much time tweaking config files instead of playing games. Now, we share that knowledge so you can spend more time playing.
