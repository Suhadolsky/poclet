Most handhelds use software emulation. The **Analogue Pocket** uses FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) to simulate the hardware itself.
It's not "running" Game Boy; it *becomes* a Game Boy.

## That Screen. 1600x1440. 💎

The screen has 10x the resolution of the original Game Boy.
This allows for "perfect" pixel scaling. It can mimic the green tint of the DMG, the grid lines of the GBC, and the sub-pixels of the GBA with absolute precision.
There is no blur. No lag. Just photons hitting your retinas.

## OpenFPGA 🔓

Since the "Jailbreak" firmware updates, you can play SNES, Genesis, and Arcade games from an SD card. It’s no longer just for cartridge collectors.

## Verdict

It's heavy. It's expensive. It plays cartridges. It is the Rolex of handhelds.
